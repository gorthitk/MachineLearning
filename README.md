Machine Learning Program for Yelp Dataset Challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge)

This Java program is designed to extract and pre-process the data from the yelp dataset before feeding it to the machine learning (Naive Bayes, Linear Regression and SVM) algorithms.

The data from yelp is provided in JSON format. The dump has been exported onto a MongoDB server and the Java program connects and fetches the data from here for pre-processing.

This has been done as part of the final project for (CS6037) Machine Learning course, at University of Cincinnati, taught by professor Dr.Anca Ralescu (http://ceas.uc.edu/hucero/contacts/anca1.html). As well as for the yelp data challenge.
